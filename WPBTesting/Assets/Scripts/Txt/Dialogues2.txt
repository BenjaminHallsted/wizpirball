true true Right you scurvy dogs!
false false Welcome to Molluka Pirate Island!
false false Let's see what you're made of.
false false Step forth to begin your training!
false false Right then, here be the basics. 
false false The staff you hold channels your mana [top right/left of screen].
false false Use your mana to cast spells, but remember that it needs time to recharge.
false false I suppose I don't have to remind you to keep an eye on your health [top right/left of screen], take too much damage and you'll surely perish!
false false Now, let's go over combat. 
false false Your means of attack is hitting baseballs at your enemies.
false true See those targets out there?
false true Fire 3 baseballs at them.
false true Remember that this is just practice.
false true In real combat you'll have to adjust for enemy movement.
false true Great!
false true Now let's use magic.
false true Choose a spell and simply aim and fire.
false true Spells use mana to make more devastating attacks!
false true Each spell has its own unique effects but you can only have 3 at time.
false true Now, fire each spell you have at the target.
false true Alright!
false true Now you need to learn some defense.
false true If an enemy fires a ball, you can hit it back to them if you catch it at the right moment.
false true Deflect 3 balls, you land-lubber!
false true You got some defense there lad, but you can't deflect every ball.
false true You're going to have to learn how to use a shield!
false true Activate that one over there.
false true It's that floating white square.
false true Walk over to it and get the shield up.
false false Shiver me timbers!
false false You can learn!
false false These shields block all baseballs, even your own for 3 hits.
false false So deactivate them when you don't need'em.
false false Time for the final test!
false false Let's see the two of you go at it!
